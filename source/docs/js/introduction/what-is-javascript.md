# what-is-javascript

**JavaScript** (commonly abbreviated as **JS**) is a [**programming language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) primarily used to develop dynamic and interactive web content. JS is officially defined as a [**scripting**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) language that is [**lightweight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_programming_language), [**interpreted**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language), or [**just-in-time compiled**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) with [**first-class functions**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function). JS is one of the three core technologies of the [**World Wide Web**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), alongside [**HTML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [**CSS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

```{note} Despite the similarity in names, [**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\)) and JavaScript are entirely different languages with different design goals.

## **History & Background**

- **Creator & Origins**: JavaScript was created in a very short time (legend says 10 days!) by [**Brendan Eich**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in 1995 while he was working for [**Netscape Communications Corporation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape).

- **Original Name**: It was initially called [**Mocha**](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript), then later renamed [**LiveScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Birth_at_Netscape).

- **Rebranded as JavaScript**: The name "JavaScript" was adopted as a marketing tactic to ride on the hype and popularity of the [**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\)) language at the time.

- **Standardization**: Standardized by [**Ecma International**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) as [**ECMAScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), via the [**ECMA-262**](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) document.
